  I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Architecture, Circuits, and Compilers](http://vlsiarch.eecs.harvard.edu) group at Harvard University working with Prof. Gu-Yeon Wei and David Brooks.
  
  My research broadly investigates design methodologies for energy-efficient and reliable hardware systems. 
  I am currently working on co-design methodologies for building specialized architectures for machine learning applications that leverage dense, fault-prone embedded non-volatile memories.
  
  I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Sciences and Computer Engineering from Brown University.
  
  Before pursuing my Ph.D., I graduated with a B.S. (2008) and a M.Sc. (2010) from Universit&agrave; di Roma La Sapienza
  
  You can find my full CV [here](assets/MarcoDonato_cv.pdf)

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
